The weight-space restructuring idea will work with any clustering algorithm which 
provides a point location for each cluster that we can push image vectors toward so 
Mean-Shift, EM-GMM and Agglomerative-Hierarchical (and K-Means) would be compatible, but 
DBSCAN seems problematic.

Do you feel comfortable with modifying the test_cluster.py script and experiementing with 
clustering while I continue the restructuring experiment?
